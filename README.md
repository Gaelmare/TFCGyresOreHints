Lowcode mod to alter mineral vein generation.

Adds "Hint Rocks" to TFC world generation for mineral veins.

In 1.18, also buffs spawn rates and sizes of all mineral veins except gypsum and halite and adds more veins spawning in the mountains and deep underground.

Recommended for anyone who wants more veins and more in the veins when they are found.

Mod Release description for 1.20

Initial 1.20 release!

Most mineral and metal veins will spawn underground indicators. This will help finding graphite, along with all the other veins deep down.

Only mountainous iron veins are buffed, since most TFC vein rarities have changed enough that it's unclear what change would be good.

Even though kaolinite clay spawn conditions are different now, the marble hint rocks still spawn around kaolinite clay discs. Go find that clay!

Disc veins, like halite, lignite, and bituminous coal do not have working indicators yet. https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft/issues/2588

Good luck, and Happy TFC!

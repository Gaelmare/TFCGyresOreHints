Some of the veins were too small and too rare, so sizes, rarities, and some shapes changed!$(br2)Coal veins are now much larger horizontal discs with fewer inclusions. Most other mineral veins are more common and doubled in radius. Y-level restrictions are the same."

These veins may be larger, denser, and purer.$(br2)There are no iron ores that spawn deep as sedimentary and igneous extrusive rocks do not spawn on the bottom layer."

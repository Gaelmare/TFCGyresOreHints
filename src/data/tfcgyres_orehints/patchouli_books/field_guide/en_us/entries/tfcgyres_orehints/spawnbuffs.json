Some of the veins were too small and too rare, so sizes, rarities, and some shapes changed!$(br2)Coal veins are now much larger horizontal discs with fewer inclusions. Most other mineral veins are more common and doubled in radius. Y-level restrictions are the same."

More veins below y-level 0 now exist for all metamorphic and igneous intrusive ores: metal, mineral, and diamonds/emeralds. These veins may be larger, denser, and purer.$(br2)In the mountains, there are small, dense iron, copper and sulfur veins."
